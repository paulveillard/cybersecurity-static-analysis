## What is Static Analysis?
[Static analysis](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/inspector-user-guide-windows/top/getting-started/dynamic-analysis-vs-static-analysis.html) is the testing and evaluation of an application by examining the code without executing the application.

The primary advantage of static analysis: It examines all possible execution paths and variable values, not just those invoked during execution. Thus static analysis can reveal errors that may not manifest themselves until weeks, months or years after release. This aspect of static analysis is especially valuable in security assurance, because security attacks often exercise an application in unforeseen and untested ways.
